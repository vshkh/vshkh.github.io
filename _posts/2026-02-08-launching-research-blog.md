This site now serves two roles:

1. Academic profile and publication-facing portfolio.
2. Research notebook for ongoing technical writeups.

Planned post topics:

- Physics-aware neural network constraints (drift, quantization, noise).
- Optical neural network simulation design choices.
- Autonomous driving multi-task learning experiments.
- Reproducible PyTorch experiment workflow and benchmarking notes.

I will use these posts to document experiments, results, and practical engineering lessons from research projects.
