## About

I am a Computer Science and Engineering student at the University of California, Irvine, with a research focus at the intersection of machine learning, robotics, and optical/physics-aware computing.

My current work studies how real-world hardware constraints, such as drift, quantization, and noise, affect neural network behavior and reliability.

- Physics-aware machine learning
- Optical neural networks
- Robust learning under hardware constraints
- Autonomous systems and control
