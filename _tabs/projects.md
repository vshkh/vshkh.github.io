## Selected Projects

### Multi-Task Autonomous Driving with Optical-Flow FoE Prediction

- Built a multi-head ConvLSTM model for autonomous motion prediction.
- Achieved 94.7% validation accuracy for maneuver classification (Stop, Straight, Turn).
- Implemented a sensor-fusion workflow over 2,700+ KITTI frames.
- Reached 0.26 RMSE for velocity prediction through Optical Flow + Focus of Expansion integration.

### Optics-Aware Neural Network with Physical Constraints

- Built a TOML config-driven PyTorch experimentation framework.
- Ran a 216-run ablation over MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10.
- Added layer-level hooks for drift, quantization, and noise injection.
- Used results to study robustness in hardware-constrained inference settings.
