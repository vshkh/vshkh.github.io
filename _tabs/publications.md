## Publications

Peer-reviewed publications will be listed here as they become available.

## Manuscripts in Preparation

### Physics-Aware Neural Networks Under Hardware Constraints

- Focus: neural network robustness under drift, noise, and quantization.
- Platform: config-driven PyTorch pipeline with repeatable sweeps.
- Status: ongoing research in the UC Irvine EECS ecosystem.

### Free-Space Diffractive Optical Neural Networks

- Focus: simulation and analysis of optical architectures with Fourier-based transformations.
- Platform: PyTorch-based optical modeling experiments.
- Status: ongoing research with Prof. Maxim Shcherbakov's lab.

## Notes

- I will add preprints, conference papers, and poster links here as they are released.
